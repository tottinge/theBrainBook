## What is work?

Travel in time back about 60,000 years. As far as our archeological 
records and age estimations go, you should be able to look around and 
find some homonids. Two legged apes, wandering about, living fairly
simple lives. The poor things are hardly different from other beasts. 

They live in a physical and literal world

Imagine you are alive in 400 BC. A lot of interesting things are going 
on in the world at this time. AArtaxerxes II is king of Persia, which
is a major world economic and military power. The spartans turn on the
Persians -- probably good movie fodder. London is being built. The 
catapult is invented. The buddha is born. 

Imagine you live in a town in 400 bc. What do your neighbors do for
a living? Some build sculpture, possibly. More are laborers and 
merchants. Some work in iron, some in wood. Some farm, bake, or
cook. Some sweep and clean. Some are slaves.  The lucky few are
scribes who either write what people say, or else copy documents.

If you saw anyone at work, you would know that they were working.
Their work requires a lot of motion and sometimes physical might.
Each kind of work has pretty specific physical motions, and you
can probably tell a person's occupation by glancing at them.

A very few people are politicians and philosophers and ministers
and monks. Their core work is not visible, though much of it is
done in discussions and some aspects of their work involve 
visibility.

Inventors and engineers exist, but are quite rare.

Try 1400 AD (a leap year!). 1800 years later. Henry IV is on the
throne of England and the English and Scottish are fighting (no
big surprise). There is court intrigue in Vietnam. Frederick I
is the new Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus ... for a very short
time. The Ottomans empire is at war with everyone. The Medicis
are big in France. 

What do your neighbors do? Most of them are still laborers. 
Quite a few are soldiers, but the rest are mostly doing physical
work or at least physical work. Some create performances --
music, acting -- but most create physical goods or services.
For most everyone, there is something they can point at or
kick and say "I did that."

If you are upscale enough, you may live near politicans and
artists and philosophers, but likely you do not.  However,
there are inventors and engineers whose physical work requires
a great deal of math and physics and science. 


Okay, now let's come back to the present. Who are your
neighbors? Odds are that 70% or more of them (and you, 
yourself) work in science, engineering, managing, 
advertising, selling, designing, and the like. You 
probably work in ideas, thoughts, heuristics, and 
equations.  

Because you read this book, you probably work in loops, 
queries, layout, test frameworks, performance, security,
and languages.  Your job may be helping other people do
their jobs, in which case your actual work is the change
in other people's processes and thinking. 

Your goods are nonphysical. They are ideas, processes, and
rules. The paper and disks on which these are written are
not perceivably heavier after you have applied your work 
than before.

Chances are that most of the people you know work in
nonphysical goods. They might be lawyers, managers, engineers,
and policy makers. They probably are not people who mold, 
mills, assemble, scrub, polish, nail, carve, attach, and
build.

Some of them may be cabinet-makers, mechanics, and factory
workers. A few may be landscapers and cooks. 

But here we are, less than 200 years from the industrial 
revolution. As a result of efficient production of goods
and machines, we have transformed into a whole new 
species of human -- we are the millions of people across
three or four new generations of people who think for a
living.
