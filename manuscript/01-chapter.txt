# Chapter 1

## This is about software.

This book is not about a specific program, app, or game. 

It is about the brains of software developers, and how to use them better. This
is especially interesting if you happen to be 
    a) a software developer or someone who works with software developers
    b) the owner of a brain.


## We want to help you think more clearly.

We find that a better (if imperfect) understanding how our brains work helps
us to manage stress and complexity better, helps us get more work done, and
helps us to understand when we should stop or pause.

The ideas in this book have been harvested from experts by us. We're not 
organizational psychologist by trade, but developers and consultants and
trainers and managers (each of us is all 4). We will explain these ideas
as we understand them, and describe how using these ideas has helped us.

## We needed to think more clearly.

We could have quit our jobs, earned advanced degrees in psychology, and 
then sat down to write a book, but we didn't. We have work to do.

In fact, that's why we are writing this... we need to think clearly and
remind ourselves of why we learned these things just as much as we want
to help you.

So... enjoy, give feedback, correct us, cite us, argue with us.

It should be fun.
